# Football_Match_Prediction

## ABSTRACT
Machine Learning (ML) techniques have shown great promise in classification problems. One of
the important classification problems is the prediction of the results of sports matches, since
sports and sports betting industries are of substantial monetary value. In this project, we aim to
predict football match outcomes, particularly that of the English Premier League, one of the
most popular football leagues in the world. Real-world in-match events’ data of the past 10
years has been used along with EA Sports’ FIFA data for the teams involved to build ML-based
classifiers which predict the results of football matches

## PROJECT OUTLINE
* Our work was based on predicting the Full Time Result (i.e. Home team WIN, LOSE or DRAW) of an English Premier League match based on the statistics collected during the match and the past history of the two playing teams.
* The data used for the project is a combination of real-world statistics and data from EA Sports’ FIFA. 
* The ‘Dataset’ section describes the data and data collection in detail.
* After combining and processing the data, we tried several models which are well known for classification tasks, for predicting the match result – Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Multilayer perceptron, Support Vector Machines and a Naive Bayes classifier.
* We also tried K-nearest neighbors, but the results were not satisfactory.
* Metric of evaluation - We have used accuracy as the metric to judge the performance of these different models.
